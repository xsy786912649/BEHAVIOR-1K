# :material-laptop: **Examples**

**`OmniGibson`** ships with many demo scripts highlighting its modularity and diverse feature set intended as a set of building blocks enabling your research. Let's try them out!

***

## :material-cog: **A quick word about macros**

??? question annotate "Why macros?"

    Macros enforce global behavior that is consistent within an individual python process but can differ between processes. This is useful because globally enabling all of **`OmniGibson`**'s features can cause unnecessary slowdowns, and so configuring the macros for your specific use case can optimize performance.

`macros` define a globally available set of magic numbers or flags set throughout **`OmniGibson`**. These can either be directly set in `omnigibson.macros.py`, or can be programmatically modified at runtime via:

```{.python .annotate}
from omnigibson.macros import gm, macros

gm.<GLOBAL_MACRO> = <VALUE> # (1)!
macros.<OG_DIRECTORY>.<OG_MODULE>.<MODULE_MACRO> = <VALUE> # (2)!
```

1. `gm` refers to the "global" macros -- i.e.: settings that generally impact the entire **`OmniGibson`** stack. These are usually the only settings you may need to modify.
2. `macros` captures all remaining macros defined throughout **`OmniGibson`**'s codebase -- these are often hardcoded default settings or magic numbers defined in a specific module. These can also be overridden, but we recommend inspecting the module first to understand how it is used.

Many of our examples set various `macros` settings at the beginning of the script, and is a good way to understand use cases for modifying them!

```{.python .annotate}

??? note "Difference between `ParticleApplier/Removers` and `ParticleSource/Sinks`"
    The key difference between `ParticleApplier/Removers` and `ParticleSource/Sinks` is that `Applier/Removers`
    requires contact (if using `ParticleProjectionMethod.ADJACENCY`) or overlap
    (if using `ParticleProjectionMethod.PROJECTION`) in order to spawn / remove particles, and generally only spawn
    particles at the contact points. `ParticleSource/Sinks` are special cases of `ParticleApplier/Removers` that
    always use `ParticleProjectionMethod.PROJECTION` and always spawn / remove particles within their projection volume,
    irregardless of overlap with other objects.

## :material-wrench: **Simulator**
These examples showcase useful functionality from **`OmniGibson`**'s monolithic `Simulator` object.

??? question "What's the difference between `Environment` and `Simulator`?"

    The [`Simulator`](../reference/simulator.md) class is a lower-level object that:
      
      * handles importing scenes and objects into the actual simulation
      * directly interfaces with the underlying physics engine

    The [`Environment`](../reference/envs/env_base.md) class thinly wraps the `Simulator`'s core functionality, by:

      * providing convenience functions for automatically importing a predefined scene, object(s), and robot(s) (via the `cfg` argument), as well as a [`task`](../reference/tasks/task_base.md)
      * providing a OpenAI Gym interface for stepping through the simulation

    While most of the core functionality in `Environment` (as well as more fine-grained physics control) can be replicated via direct calls to `Simulator` (`og.sim`), it requires deeper understanding of **`OmniGibson`**'s infrastructure and is not recommended for new users.

### **State Saving and Loading Demo**
